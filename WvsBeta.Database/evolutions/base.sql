-- This is the base SQL file, you can put comments in the top.
-- Try to prevent too destructive queries and keep your queries
-- as generic as possible (eg do not refer to a database).
-- Make sure your Evolution works both back and forth (rename
-- the file to a non-sql file so it will do the DOWN logic).
------- UP -------

-- Put your up queries here, such as CREATE TABLE

------- DOWN -------

-- Put your down queries here, such as DROP TABLE, etc.
